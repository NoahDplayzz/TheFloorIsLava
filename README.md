# TheFloorIsLava
A simple spigot plugin that adds the floor is lava to minecraft. This idea was not by me but I created a plugin for it.

To start the game run '/start' if your OP or have the permission thefloorislava.start

TODO:
 - Test other versions
 - ~~Permission (thefloorislava.start)~~
 - ~~Config~~
	- ~~Custom timers~~
	- ~~Custom block~~
	- ~~Custom border size~~
	- ~~Custom increase amount~~

### Config
```YAML
startHeight: 0
borderSize: 5000
block: LAVA
gracePeriod: 200
roundTimer: 900
increaseAmount: 1
```
